const and let
const is a new keyword in ES6 for declaring variables. const is more powerful than var. Once used, the variable can’t be reassigned. In other words, it’s an immutable variable except when it used with objects.

Arrow functions
Arrow functions – also called “fat arrow” functions, from CoffeeScript (a transcompiled language) — are a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They utilize a new token, =>, that looks like a fat arrow. Arrow functions are anonymous and change the way this binds in functions.the arrow function seems more readable and clean

Template Literals
Template literals or template strings are pretty cool. We don’t have to use the plus (+) operator to concatenate strings, or when we want to use a variable inside a string.

Default parameters
when you forget to write the parameter, it won’t return an undefined error because the parameter is already defined in the default. So when you run your function with a missed parameter, it will take the value of the default parameter t, and it will not return an error!

Classes
Classes are the core of object oriented programming (OOP). They make your code more secure and encapsulated. Using classes gives your code a nice structure and keeps it oriented.To create a class, use the class keyword followed by the name of the class with two curly brackets.

Inheritance 
Inheritance is an important concept in object oriented programming. In the classical inheritance, methods from base class get copied into derived class. In JavaScript, inheritance is supported by using prototype object. Some people call it "Prototypal Inheriatance" and some people call it "Behaviour Delegation".To inherit from another class, use the extends keyword followed by the name of the class you want to inherit from. it use super() keywoard to use the paraent class.
